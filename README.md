# 🧪 Playwright Test Automation Project

This project aims to provide a **front-end automated testing setup** using **[Playwright](https://playwright.dev/)**, fully containerized with **Docker**, integrated with **GitHub Actions** for CI/CD, and featuring **[Allure Report](https://docs.qameta.io/allure/)** for test reporting.  
A future integration with **Cucumber/Gherkin** may also be added to support BDD-style test writing.

## 🧱 Overview

The main goals of this project are:
- ✅ Build a **scalable and maintainable** Playwright test framework.
- 🐳 Run tests consistently across environments using **Docker**.
- ⚙️ Automate execution through **GitHub Actions** CI workflows.
- 📊 Generate detailed reports with **Allure Report**.
- 🥒 Optionally integrate **Cucumber/Gherkin** for behavior-driven testing.

## 🧩 Future Roadmap

| Feature | Status | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| Playwright base setup | ✅ | Core testing framework using Playwright. |
| Docker integration | 🚧 | Containerized environment for consistent execution. |
| GitHub Actions workflow | 🌀 | CI pipeline for test automation. |
| Allure reporting | 🚧 | Test result visualization and trend analysis. |
| Cucumber/Gherkin support | 🔜 | BDD syntax for more readable test scenarios. |

## 💡 Example: Cucumber/Gherkin Scenario (Future)

```gherkin
Feature: Login
  Scenario: Successful login with valid credentials
    Given the user navigates to the login page
    When they enter valid username and password
    Then they should be redirected to the main dashboard
```

## 🧾 Best Practices

- Follow the **Page Object Model (POM)** design pattern for better scalability.
- Keep tests **independent and deterministic**.
- Avoid hard-coded values; prefer **environment variables**.
- Use **Allure Report** to monitor test results, performance, and failure trends.
- Keep CI/CD pipelines fast, isolated, and reproducible.
